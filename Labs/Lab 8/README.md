# LAB 8 Overview
This Python script that I created that leverages a couple new(to me) python libraries to send "DID YOU KNOW" facts generated by wikipedia to your email. We scrape https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page for "Did you know ..." facts!

 I will setup a cronjob to run this and by the end of this year I will learn so many new facts, that I will be a genius! Please be warned this sript was for a class assignment, and uses a dummy gmail account with the creds in plaintext for sake of development speed. The email also gets caught in most spam filters. 

First, let's install BeautifulSoup since that is once dependacy I did not have on my machine

```bash
$ pip install BeautifulSoup4
```
We are going to use beautiful soup to help with web scrapping

You can pull down the script from here to try it out on your machine!
```
git clone git@https://github.com/bjornburrell/it3080c-scripts/tree/main/Labs/Lab 8/Lab 8.py
```

Run the following command after you clone this directory and navigate to it:

```
cd THEDIRECTORYYOUJUSTCLONED
python3 Lab8.py
```

The syntax above will post a request to wikipedia and send an email using smtplib
