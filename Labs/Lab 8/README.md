# LAB 8 Overview
This Python script that I created, which uses a couple libraries to send facts generated by wikipedia to your email - AT THE TOUCH OF A BUTTON. I will setup a cronjob to run this and by the end of this year I will learn so many new facts that I will be able to quit my pursuit of an IT professional and become a wikipedia genius

First, let's install BeautifulSoup since that is once dependacy I did not have on my machine

```bash
$ pip install BeautifulSoup4
```
We are going to use beautiful soup to help with web scrapping

You can pull down the script from here to try it out on your machine!
```
git clone git@https://github.com/bjornburrell/it3080c-scripts/tree/main/Labs/Lab 8/Lab 8.py
```

Run the following command after you clone this directory and navigate to it:

```
cd THEDIRECTORYYOUJUSTCLONED
python3 Lab8.py
```

The syntax above will post a request to wikipedia and send an email using smtplib
